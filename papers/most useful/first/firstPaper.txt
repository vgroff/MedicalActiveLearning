2d images uses dilated convolution (different sizes(?)) with 181x181 recptive field(?).
Features are then concatenated and fed into a classifier. Softmax layer then produces probability type things

method:
minimize a function that is similar to grabcut, with two terms: the "unary" and "pairwise" energy terms.
Then we need a way of generating labels once we have some network parameters, and we need to update parameters given the labels.
Somewhat confused by phi prime, wondering if typo



user defines a bounding box
objective function
whats the energy terms? pairwise energy?

read grabcut to get an idea of the energy function:
smoothness term makes sense, not sure what the U term is for though.
