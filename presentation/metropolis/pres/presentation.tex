\section{3D Image Segmentation}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Medical Image Segmentation}

    \begin{block}{3D Medical Image Segmentation}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.20]{pictures/seg}
    \caption{Segmentation of the left atrium}
    \label{fig:heartSegTruth}
    \end{figure}
        
    \textbf{Main Problem:} Laborious, particularly in 3D
    \pause
    
    \textbf{How can we automate this?}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Conditional Random Fields}

    \textbf{Aim:} Separate the set of \textit{background} pixels (\textbf{B}) from the set of \textit{object} pixels (\textbf{O})
  
    \textbf{Define a cost function to be minimized over image $\mathbf{X}$}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Conditional Random Fields}

    \begin{equation}
      E(\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{i} R_{i} + \lambda \sum_{i} \sum_{j} B_{ij}
      \label{eq:costFunc}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item $R_{i}$ - \textbf{Regional Penalty Term} - penalty for assigning pixel $i$ to either the background (\textbf{B}) or object (\textbf{O})
    \item $B_{ij}$ - \textbf{Boundary Penalty Term} - penalty depending on properties of pixels $i$ and $j$
    \item $\lambda > 0$ - a relative weighting
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Conditional Random Fields}

  $R_{i}$ - \textbf{Regional Penalty Term}

  Map (0,1) probabilities to ($\infty$, 0) penalties with negative log
  \pause  
  \begin{equation} R_{i} = \begin{cases} 
      -\log P(i \in O) & i \in \mathbf{O} \\
      -\log P(i \in B) & i \in \mathbf{B} \\
   \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
    
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Conditional Random Fields}

  $B_{ij}$ - \textbf{Boundary Penalty Term}

  Want to encourage boundaries at discontinuities in intensity
  
  \textbf{Penalize boundaries that are placed between similar pixels}

  \pause  
  \begin{equation} B_{ij} = \begin{cases}
      0 & y_{i} \neq y_{j} \\
      \frac{1}{r_{ij}} e^{\frac{-(X_{i}-X_{j})^2}{2\sigma^2}} & y_{i} \neq y_{j} \\
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:boundTerm}
  \end{equation}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item $X_{i}$ - grayscale value at pixel $i$
  \item $y_{i}$ - binary label for pixel $i$ (0 means $i \in \mathbf{B}$)
  \item $r_{ij}$ - euclidean distance between pixels $i$ and $j$
  \end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Conditional Random Fields}

  \textbf{How do we solve it?}

  Represent the image as a graph with
  \begin{itemize}
  \item One node per pixel
  \item One source node (object)
  \item One sink (background)
  \end{itemize}

  \pause
  and
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Edges between pixels have a cost $\lambda \frac{1}{r_{ij}} e^{\frac{-(X_{i}-X_{j})^2}{2\sigma^2}}$
  \item Edges between pixels and the source terminal cost  $-\log P(i \in B)$
  \item Edges between pixels and the sink terminal cost  $-\log P(i \in O)$
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{A minimum cost cut} which severs the source from the sink will now minimize the cost function
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Conditional Random Fields}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.49]{pictures/graphCuts2}
    \caption{Minimum cost cut}
    \label{fig:minCut}
  \end{figure}

  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Conditional Random Fields}

  \textbf{Maxflow:} Finding the maximal flow from source to sink

  The edges that are saturated in maxflow are those in the minimal cost cut.

  \pause
  Solve with \textbf{Breadth First Search}, by gradually saturating edges
  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Graph Cuts}

  \textbf{How do we get $P(i \in B)$ and $P(i \in O)$?}
  
  \textbf{User interaction}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item User gives seed points
  \item Probability distribution produced from seed points
  \item Probabilities of other pixels inferred from distribution
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{Works well, but...}

  \pause
  \textbf{Requires object and background pixels to have distinct intensity values}
  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Graph Cuts}

  \textbf{Requires object and background pixels to have distinct intensity values}

    \caption{Grabcut algorithm in difficult cases}
    \label{fig:minCut}
  \end{figure}
  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Graph Cuts}

  \textbf{Requires object and background pixels to have distinct intensity values}
   
  This is the case for most traditional segmentation methods

\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Convolutional Neural Networks}

  \textbf{Advantages}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Spatial operations
  \item Learning
  \item Performance
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Disadvantages}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Computationally expensive
  \item Poor generalisation to unseen types
  \item Need large datasets - expensive for medical imagery
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Convolutional Neural Networks}

  \textbf{Classification CNNs -} gradually extract larger features from smaller ones

  \pause
  \textbf{U-Net -} gradually re-combine those features to produce a segmentation map
  
\end{frame}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Segmentation CNNs}

  \textbf{Improvements since original U-Net}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Residual blocks

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% AIMS AND DESIGN %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Aims and Design}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Aims}

  \textbf{Aims:}
  
  Minimize the disadvantages of CNNs so that they can be used for 3D image segmentation
  
  \textbf{Disadvantages}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Computationally expensive
  \item Poor generalisation to unseen types
  \item Need large datasets - expensive for medical imagery
  \end{enumerate}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{BIFSeg}

  \textbf{Bounding-box Image-specific Fine-Tuning Segmentations} (BIFSeg)
  Combines CNN and CRF

  Leverages user corrections
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Draw bounding box around area of interest
  \item CNN and CRF give initial guess
  \item User provides correction scribbles
  \item CNN fine-tunes using corrections and gives corrected result
  \end{enumerate}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{BIFSeg}

  \begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.46]{pictures/heartBifSeg2}
    \caption{The steps in the BIFSeg framework. In \textit{blue} is the ground truth, in \textit{cyan} the initial guess,
      in \textit{yellow} pixels relabelled as background and in \textit{red} is the final result}
    \label{fig:minCut}
  \end{figure}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{BIFSeg}

  \textbf{Two things going on:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    \textbf{Combining CNN and CRF}
  
    CNN softmax output used as probability values for calculating $R_{i}$
  }
    \pause
  \item{
  \textbf{Fine-Tuning CNN using CRF}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item CNN, CRF and scribbles produce segmentation
  \item CNN trained to match segmentation
  \item Repeat steps 1 and 2 $n$ times
  \end{enumerate}
  }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{BIFSeg}


  \textbf{Fine-Tuning CNN using CRF}

  CNN loss function is \textbf{weighted} on a per-pixel basis during fine-tuning,
  such that the weight for pixel $i$ is

  \begin{equation} w_{i} = \begin{cases} 
      0 & i \in \mathbf{U} \\
      w & i \in \mathbf{S} \\
      1 & \textrm{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
  \end{equation}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{U} - set of pixels for which the current segmentation is uncertain
  \item \textbf{S} - set of user scribbles
  \end{itemize}

  \pause
  Pixels in \textbf{U} are either \textbf{geodesically} near a scribble of opposite label
  or have $P_i$ near $0.5$
  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Design}

  \textbf{BIFSeg works on unseen object types} - though it
  needs a CNN that has learned \textbf{generalisable features}

  Performs better and with less user interaction on seen object types

  \pause
  \textbf{Transfer learning}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Start by using a CNN trained in generalised segmentation
  \item After $n$ images have been segmented, add them to a dataset
  \item Load a new CNN with the generalised CNN weights and train it on the dataset
  \item Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all images have been segmented
  \end{enumerate}
