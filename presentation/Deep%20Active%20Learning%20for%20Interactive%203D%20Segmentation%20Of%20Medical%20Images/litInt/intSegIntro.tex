Image segmentation has been attempted long before the widespread use of CNNs. Most of these methods either have limited success in generalizing or require extensive user input for good results (e.g. intelligent scissors). Many work with colour statistics, meaning that when the object and its background are similar in colour, the segmentation may have limited success (e.g. magic wand). Many are also incapable of working in 3D.

The goal of all segmentation problems is to reduce an $n \times m$ array of pixel color or grayscale values into an $n \times m$ array of binary values, where each pixel is either part of the \textit{object} we are segmenting, or part of the \textit{background}.
