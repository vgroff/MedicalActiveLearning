UI-Net is a simple framework for interactive image segmentation \cite{UI-Net}. The network is built on the U-Net architecture \cite{uNet} (see section \ref{sec:uNet}). \cite{fcn}. The network takes as input not just the image, but also a seed mask, representing pixels that the user has re-labeled. The network then needs to be trained both in segmentation and in responding to corrections provided in the seed mask. For this, user interactions are simulated during the training stage, by randomly adding 5\% of misclassified pixels to the seed mask.

Their results show that their segmentation results are poorer after a single user interaction than before the interaction, and they take several iterations to improve.
