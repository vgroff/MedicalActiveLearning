We can augment our smaller dataset to make it larger. This amounts to altering the images. The CNN should learn about spatial invariance, and thus it is sensible to add spatial shifts, rotational shifts or mirroring to the existing dataset. Elastic deformations and adding white noise can also be effective ways of augmenting the dataset.
