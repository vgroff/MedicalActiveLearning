As stated in the introduction, getting large and representative datasets of medical imagery is expensive. Training on a small datset is likely to cause heavy overfitting, meaning the CNN will fail to generalize to unseen problems. 

In our case it is particularly pressing to find ways of dealing with this issue, since small datasets will likely be common in using our program. Users will start with completely unlabeled dataset of image types that the CNN has (probably) never encountered before. The CNN is then only useful to them if they can train it to adequate performance by only labeling a small fraction of the total dataset.
